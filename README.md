Leave Notes wherever you are for friends, family, or new people to find!

By Chris Groce and Kevin McGinn

Known Bugs and Issues:

Cannot refresh message list and friends list at the same time, which can force users to refresh the messages screen after adding a friend to see new content if using the Friends Only filter.

Occasional issues with the on-screen back button coming from the help and settings views

Settings view is just filler, and not connected to anything.

MySimpleArrayAdapter class was created for an attempt to change how the main messages display looked, but we were unable to get it to work. Thus, the class is not connected to anything.
